//When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history:

//1. Fetch openweathermap.org current and future weather information for the city searched (fetch function)

//Current weather conditions to display: city name, date, weather conditions icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed (create element, add content and append for each value)

//Future weather conditions are shown in a 5 day forecast displaying the date, icon for weather conditions, temperature and humidity (create 5 bootstrap cards in the div for each day, then create element, add content and append for each value needed?)

//2. Add searched city into local storage (event listener on the search button - function to create button for city and store as arra)
//When the user presses the stored city button, the app displays the stats again (getItem from local storage, add event listener that calls the show temperature function)
